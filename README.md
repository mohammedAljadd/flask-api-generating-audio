# flask-api-returning-audio

    A flask api returning an audio telling whether or not an image exists in the server. 
    All we have to do is to send a json file where we specify the name as "image_name


    We converted a string to audio file, that will be played directly in 
    your machine, using python gtts module.

    You have to change the config file where 
    I specified the images and the audio location.


    This flask api support three languages : English, German and French
